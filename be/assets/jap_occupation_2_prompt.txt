Under the scorching sun, a weary 13-year-old girl trudges through a dusty path lined with coconut trees. Her frail frame carries a heavy basket of tapioca. In the distance, a group of Japanese soldiers approaches, their boots kicking up dust. The girl freezes, her eyes wide with fear as chickens scatter around her. A mother nearby quickly gathers her own children, whispering soothing words while glancing anxiously at the soldiers. The atmosphere is tense, filled with the sound of clucking chickens and distant military commands.
